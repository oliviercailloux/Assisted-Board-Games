= Documentation of the checkers game creation

Our goal was to create the interface of the checkers game. The user can access the game from the menu by clicking the Play button of the checkers game. 

After pressing this button, it will redirect the user to the selected game. He can start a new game or continue an existing one by using his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Draughts_Notation[Portable Draughts Notaton] (PDN). 
We also made sure to respect a similar layout to the chess game in terms of colors and available buttons. The goal is to have a coherent environment through the different games. 

The interface of the checkers game was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript. 




It is interesting to know that it is not possible to load a game if no PDN has been entered.  
There is now a "Quit" button to return to the Main Menu.
We also display in real time the player who has to play (Black or White). 
There is also a move suggestion useful for the novices to know the possible moves of a piece in the game
